Based on the popular children's book [Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?](https://amzn.com/0805047905),
this skill shows how to track multiple variables, save state to an array, and retrieve state.


You may launch this skill by saying "talk to brown bear", or you can jump right in with "tell brown bear I see a red bird".

Continue describing what you see:  "I see a purple cat", "I see a green frog", etc.

When you are done, just say "I see a teacher".  The skill will then recite the list of animals back to you.
